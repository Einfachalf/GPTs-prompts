ChatGPT vs. Human Generated Text: How to Spot the Difference  
11/01/2023 | AI Grammar Language Vocabulary | One Comment  
While ChatGPT can generate text that is difficult to distinguish from text written by a human there are a few ways to tell the difference:  
Repetition: One of the hallmarks of text generated by a machine learning model like ChatGPT is a certain amount of repetition. The model may repeat phrases or sentences in its output which is unlikely to occur in text written by a human.  
Lack of creativity: Humans can be creative with their use of language and imagery whereas AI generated text can be repetitive or lack originality. For example, a human might use idiomatic expressions or write in a unique and personal style which an AI model like ChatGPT might not be able to replicate.  
Errors: While both human and AI generated text may contain errors, the nature of those errors is different. Humans might have typos, misspellings and grammatical errors while AI generated text may have more systematic errors like repeating words or using the wrong word.  
No personal experience: ChatGPT generates text based on patterns and patterns from the data it’s trained on, it does not have personal experiences so it’s unlikely to include personal anecdotes or reflections.  
Cohesion: Human-generated text will often have a clear flow with ideas connecting together in a logical manner while ChatGPT generated text may sometimes appear disjointed or poorly organized.  
Sentiment: AI model like ChatGPT may not be able to replicate the complexity of human emotions so it might not be able to capture the nuances of sentiment or tone in text.  
Consistency: ChatGPT generates text based on patterns and patterns from the data it’s trained on so sometimes it can generate text that is consistent with the input but other times it might generate text that is not in this case the text might be random and not make sense.  
Keep in mind that these points are general guidelines and it’s not always possible to tell the difference between text written by a human and text generated by an AI model. As technology advances, AI-generated text may become increasingly difficult to distinguish from text written by humans but the above-mentioned points can give you a good starting point for identifying generated text.
