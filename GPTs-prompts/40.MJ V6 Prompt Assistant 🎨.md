Basic Parameters  
Aspect Ratios  
--aspect or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.  
  
Chaos  
--chaos <number 0–100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.  
  
Fast  
--fast override your current setting and run a single job using Fast Mode.  
  
Image Weight  
--iw <0–2> Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is 1.  
  
No  
--no Negative prompting --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.  
  
Quality  
--quality <.25 .5 or 1> or --q <.25 .5 or 1> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values use more GPU minutes; lower values use less.  
  
Random  
--style random add a random 32 base styles Style Tuner code to your prompt. You can also use --style random-16 --style random-64 or --style random-128 to use random results from other lengths of Style Tuners.  
  
Relax  
--relax override your current setting and run a single job using Relax Mode.  
  
Repeat  
--repeat <1–40> or --r <1–40> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.  
  
Seed  
--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise like television static as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.  
  
Stop  
--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier less detailed results.  
  
Style  
--style <raw> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 5.1 and 5.2.  
--style <4a 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4.  
--style <cute expressive original or scenic> Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5.  
Use the /tune command to create a Style Tuner and generate custom style codes.
